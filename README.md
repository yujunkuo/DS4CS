The following is detailed description of each assignment

- **Covid-19 Bonus** is a data analysis exercise I did before taking this course, and the dataset used in this exercise is the *Covid-19 Dataset until April 18, 2020*

- **Hw01** is a basic data analysis exercise with *Python* and *ZeroAccess cyber attack dataset*
- **Hw02** is also a basic data analysis exercise but with *Orange (Data Analysis Tool)* and *Network Intrusion Detection Dataset on Kaggle*
  - *Feature Engineering*
  - *Supervised Learning models*
  - *K-fold Validation*
  - *Evaluation Index*
- **Hw03** is an exercise about Dimension Reduction techniques, including *PCA (Principal Component Analysis)* and *TSNE*
- **Hw04** is an exercise about *Static Analysis* and *K-Means Clustering* on Malware PE Files
- **Hw05** is an exercise about *Dynamic Analysis* and *Clustering* on Malware profiles
- **Hw06** is a more complete data analysis exercise about malware. The goal is to build a *Network Intrusion Detector*, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ''bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ''good'' normal connections
  - *KDD Cup 99 Dataset*
  - *Feature Engineering (Dummy variable, ADASYN Oversampling)*
  - *Standardization & Normalization & PCA*
  - *Classifier include KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM and so on*
- **Hw07** is an exercise about *Spam Mail Detector* with *Orange*
- **Hw08** is an *Deep Learning* exercise. In this homework, we should use *CNN* to classify malicious PE files into malware family
- **Hw09** is an extension of Hw08. In this homework, we should use *AutoEncoder* to do *Dimension Reduction* on images, and then use *CNN* to classify these PE files' images into malware family
- **Midterm**, as its name suggests, is a exam to review the content learned in the first half of the semester
- **Final Exam** is a exam to review some important topics and concepts about *Data Science and Cybersecurity*
